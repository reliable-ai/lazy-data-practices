Instances represent loan applicants from 1973 to 1975, who were deemed creditworthy and were granted a loan, bringing about a natural selection bias. The data summarizes their financial situation, credit history and personal situation, including housing and number of liable people.

Among covariates, marital status and sex are jointly encoded in a single variable. Many documentation mistakes are present in the UCI entry associated with this resource \citep{hofmann1994:sg}.
