# Adding a new algorithm

1. Make a new directory named after the first author of the relevant paper.
2. In the new directory create a file named *FirstAuthor*Algorithm.py that extends Algorithm.py and implements its run method.  Read through the other methods and implement any necessary for your algorithm.
3. Add any additional needed code in that directory or a subdirectory.
4. Add the algorithm to list.py.  Be sure to also add the ParamGridSearch version(s) of your algorithm if your algorithm has a parameter that can be used for tuning.
5. Add code source, citation, and any additional site information to this README.
6. Add a LICENSE.txt to the new directory if your code is licensed under a *different* license from this repository.
